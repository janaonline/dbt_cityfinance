-- ============================================================================
-- Model: fold1aUntiedAndTied
-- Purpose:
--   Aggregates compliance and eligibility metrics for all ULBs (excluding UAs)
--   at the state and year level, based on the fold1bUntiedAndTied model.
--   Calculates counts of ULBs meeting different conditions for grants, submissions,
--   and property tax eligibility.
